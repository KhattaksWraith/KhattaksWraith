Hi there, I am a Metallurgy and Materials Engineering student. But I have a keen interest in programming and developing.
I want to learn Web & App developement, but I am confused between two of these. Any help clearing my questions will be very helpful.

REMEMBER
Next time you think of something very beautiful, then must remember yourself on that list.
